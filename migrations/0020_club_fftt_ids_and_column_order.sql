-- Two purely cosmetic follow-ups to #256, no behavior change (clubs.id stays
-- fully opaque to the app; only its text and the clubs table's column order
-- change):
--
-- 1. Every club's id becomes club-fftt-<its current digit id>, matching the
--    format already used for auto-created opponent clubs (games/import's
--    clubIdFor) and now mock/data.ts + seed.sql. This includes both the 28
--    clubs collapsed onto their real FFTT number by #253/#254 and the 5 on a
--    synthetic 99xxxxxx id (#252) — every current club.id is a bare digit
--    string, so the same rename applies uniformly to all of them.
--
--    Same FK-safe order as 0018: insert the renamed row first, repoint every
--    dependent table, then delete the old row — never a bare
--    `UPDATE clubs SET id = ...`.
--
-- 2. clubs.affiliation_number moves back to being the second column (id,
--    affiliation_number, display_name, is_archived), matching 0001's
--    original layout, before 0019's `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` re-added it at
--    the end (SQLite can only append new columns, never insert them
--    positionally). SQLite has no ALTER-based column reorder, so this
--    rebuilds the table.
--
--    IMPORTANT, hard-won the expensive way (locally, before this ever touched
--    production — see the local D1 testing that caught it): `DROP TABLE
--    clubs` — even after every dependent row has been repointed away from
--    it — cascades and deletes club_logos anyway, because club_logos.club_id
--    REFERENCES clubs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE and SQLite treats dropping the
--    parent as deleting all of its rows for cascade purposes. A plain
--    create-copy-drop-rename rebuild of `clubs` would have silently wiped
--    every club logo in production. The sequence below avoids this by never
--    dropping the CURRENT `clubs` table while anything still holds a live FK
--    to it: rename clubs out of the way first (a rename, not a delete, so
--    nothing cascades, and SQLite automatically rewrites club_logos'
--    REFERENCES clause to follow the rename), build the new `clubs`, rebuild
--    club_logos to point its FK at the new `clubs`, and only then drop the
--    renamed-away old table (by then nothing references it, so nothing
--    cascades).
--
-- Re-run safety: the id-rename statements naturally no-op on a re-run (zero
-- rows still match the bare-digit GLOB once renamed). The rebuild is
-- guarded by never dropping its own backup copy (clubs_pre_0020_backup) —
-- unlike every other migration's throwaway intermediate table, this one is
-- kept around on purpose: it's what makes the very first rebuild statement
-- fail immediately on any redeploy after the first successful run (the
-- rename target already exists), aborting the whole file cleanly before
-- touching anything, the same fail-fast contract as 0007/0016/0017/0019 —
-- just via a kept table instead of a dropped column. It holds 33 tiny rows,
-- negligible, and is a free rollback snapshot for one migration cycle.

-- club_logos discussion. Left untouched.

-- Rename clubs out of the way (not a delete, so club_logos' 33 rows survive;
